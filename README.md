# Sentiment-Analysis

## **Project Overview**  
A "sentiment analysis using machine learning" project aims to develop a system that automatically identifies and classifies the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed within a given piece of text, leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze the language patterns and key words present in the data, allowing for large-scale analysis of opinions and emotions from various sources like customer reviews, social media posts, or news articles.

## **Project Workflow**  
The workflow followed in this project is as follows:  
1. **Data Collection**: Acquiring and loading the dataset.  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing special characters, stopwords, and punctuation.  
3. **Text Preprocessing**:  
   - Tokenization  
   - Lemmatization or Stemming  
   - Converting text to lowercase  
4. **Feature Extraction**: Transforming text data using techniques like:  
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)  
   - Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)  
5. **Model Building**: Training machine learning models, including:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Naive Bayes  
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
6. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
7. **Data Visualization**: Visualizing sentiment distribution and model performance.
